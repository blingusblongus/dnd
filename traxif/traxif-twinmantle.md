[Log](./traxif-log.md);

## Class Features

### Overcharge

With your technical aptitude and ingenuity, you can
modify blasters to fire in more intense bursts. Starting at
2nd level, once on each of your turns when you hit a target
with an attack from a blaster, you can deal an additional
die of damage to that target.

This ability improves as you gain levels in this class.
You add an additional die of damage at 5th level (2 dice),
11th level (3 dice), and 17th level (4 dice). Additionally,
starting at 11th level, when you use this ability, you can
add your Intelligence modifier to the blasterâ€™s damage roll.

### Prototype

#### **Utility Matrix**

You have developed a utility matrix, an advanced, cubeshaped mechanism that rearranges its form and function
into that of other devices. Your matrix can become any of
the following gadgets, which you can use at will:

Cloaking Device. As an action, you can activate your
cloaking device to temporarily warp the light around
you and hide yourself from view. You become invisible
until the beginning of your next turn, or until you make
an attack, cast a spell, or use a gadget. Once you use this
gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.

Flashbang. As a bonus action, you throw a concussive
bomb at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby
foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can't take
reactions until the start of its next turn. Once you use this
gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.

- Forcefield Projector. As a bonus action, you can
  activate your forcefield projector, temporarily sheltering
  yourself behind a powerful electromagnetic field. Until the
  beginning of your next turn, your Armor Class increases
  by your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this gadget,
  you can't use it again on the following round.

- Grappling Hook. As a reaction when you fall,
  or as a bonus action on your turn, you can project a
  grappling hook at a target location you can see within
  your movement speed. If the target location can hold
  your weight, you are pulled there, expending movement
  normally. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity
  attacks. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on
  the following round.
  Modular Gadget. Starting at 5th level, you can
  reconfigure your utility matrix into an un-upgraded gadget

### Adaptable Omnitool

1. **Auto-Entry Device** - This device automatically attempts
   to crack physical locks or hack powered doors when set
   to do so as an action. Its ability check for doing so is 10 +
   your Intelligence modifier.
2. **Rebreather** - You can start or stop breathing through
   this apparatus as a bonus action. When doing so, you can
   breathe normally in airless environments. This device also
   shelters you from toxic fumes and other airborne poisons.
   You can't talk while breathing through this device.
3. **Scanner** - As an action, you can use your handheld
   scanner to analyze the electromagnetic spectrum around
   you. Your scanner detects the presence, number, and type
   of technological devices within 30 feet of you and can
   determine whether or not a unique construct or device has
   been present in the area within the last hour.
4. **Taser** - This device produces a debilitating current of
   electricity when you use it as an action. Make a melee
   attack roll (attack bonus equals your Intelligence bonus
   \+ your proficiency modifier) against the target. On a hit,
   the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take
   reactions until the start of its next turn. This damage
   increases to 2d8 lightning damage at when you reach 5th
   level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.

### Jump Pad

When you deploy this rectangular device as an action,
it unfolds into a 5-foot square panel that whirs with an
upward thrust. Whenever a creature moves atop the panel,
they are launched up to 30 feet in any direction they
choose. The creature takes no falling damage for the first
30 feet it falls. The jump pad deactivates after 1 minute or
when you collect it on your turn (no action required.)

## Tech Specialty - Futurist

### Advanced Subroutines

Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, your
AI takes a more active role in assisting you, rather than
merely chirping up from time to time. Your AI can run any
of the following subroutines, and you can command it to
switch between subroutines as a bonus action.

- **Genetic Algorithm**. When you take damage from a
  hostile creature, subtract 1 from the damage dealt. Each
  additional time you take damage while this subroutine is
  running, the amount you subtract from the damage dealt
  increases by 1, up to a maximum of your Intelligence
  modifier. This amount resets to 1 after 1 minute or when
  you switch subroutines.
- **Heatmap**. When you have advantage on a weapon
  attack, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage.
- **Neural Network**. When you use the Attack action to
  attack a hostile creature and miss,

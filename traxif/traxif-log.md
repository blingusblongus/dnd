# Lore

## Universe

### The Maws

Giant dead void beasts that are also somehow the hubs for interstellar travel, via the void.
There was a void beast tooth on the Comet base related to Hence, which is highly illegal.

## Party

### Qwert

Made in Vect Engine 19B/7 (or something).
Has lost about 86% of his memories
Got a vest off that was controlling his mind.

- Six Pointed star
  Inside of his armor chassis he found a 6 pointed star, very unprofessionally etched. (In a private place, not on the vest that was controlling him).
  Upon a google search, we found nothing

2023-04-17 - While passing time on the ship, Trax spent a week helping and observing Qwert. He encountered one time when Qwert accidentally discovered a secret compartment on the ship. He retains memories

### Aalar

### Toriel

### Hellabore

Looking for her helldog. Has issues with her [mom](#phaedra-onray)

### Trax (aka Billin Fappleheart)

## Characters

### Threeapuk

Lives alone on a hostile planet full of huge planetary defenses. Gave us intel on the heist, I think, since she hates the Cabal. They made some kind of trade with her for her tail, which we retrieved from table

### Phaedra Onray

Hellabore's Mom. Cabal Leader.mehow knows everything about us.

### Mr. Schiftkaffe

## Factions and Groups

### Cabal

### Rathians

We encountered Rathians first on the comet outpost we traveled to on the mission from Hence. We have since discovered that they often leave behind brains in jars - the remnants of creatures that they have tortured to the point of constantly emanating psionic energy, which they feed off of

### The Thwirl

Cutie little purple squirrel animal, first encountered on Hence. Later, a stowaway on our ship. Likes to eat batteries, etc.

## Log

We escaped the cabal heist successfully. In doing so, t

Traveling on the ship post heist:

I spent some time with Qwert, and discovered that he accidentally found a secret compartment on his own. He retained memories of it, even when I showed it to him the next day. However, when I tried to show him a different secret compartment right after, he shut down.

I found a 32-digit number connected to an encrypted package written in comments in Mandlebrodt's
When Mandlebrodet tapped into the Cabal infrastructure, he went mega and used all his computation power (his fractals got crazy) and this is when the encrypted data must have been downloaded to Mandlebrodt.

Dark Matter Engine ran out of power during our flight - something consumed a massive amount of matter all at once.
Upon searching the secret compartments, we discovered that it was the [Thwirl](#the-thwirl) that we met on Hence (forgot once, remembered the second time). It had been so long that we'd been in space, it looked like it was hungry and did a big succ of the energy in our ship.

The next week, on the ship:

- Think on that 32-digit number - and realize that it's two 16bit strings that identify the planet of my birth...the true planet. Something that my father tried very hard to keep a secret, as he knew that the Firm would want to have as much info as possible on me. I can't think of anyone that would know that except myself, my father, and my mother (god rest her soul).
- Search for that [Thwirl](#the-thwirl) - I leave out a bunch of batteries, and notice that after a few days, one of the batteries is missing.
- Take a crack at the encryption - I don't break it, but I learn a bit about the space that it's taking up in Mandlebrodt's systems. Mandlebrodt also knows it's there and can feel that space.

We reach the automated astrogation facility, where Aalar claims we'll find the air density or whatever that wee need to

## Random

### Get Over It!

Quasar's game show

## Over the Table

- Aalar has a vague memory of looking into the void during a jump, which is not good for people's brains, and seeing a giant void leviathan

## Follow Up

- [ ] Someone (or something) at the cabal heist recognized me and helped me out by shutting down the cameras, and flashing 'Traxis?' on the monitors.
  - It was around this time that the encrypted package was installed on Mandlebrodt, when they attempted to interface with the cabal systems. Now who, and/or what, could this be...
- [ ] [Hellebore's Mom](#phaedra-onray) knew everything that we had done up until the heist - we don't know any way someeone could know this outside of our party (but I trust Qwert)
- [ ] We still have [Threeapuk's](#threeapuk) tail, and haven't destroyed it yet
- [ ] We know that [Hellabore's Mom](#phaedra-onray) has Hellabore's dog somewhere in the infernal plane
